# unique

Unique generates IDs, that is all.  The IDs that are generated have the following properties.

* **Portable** - Unique generates String IDs so they can be used anywhere.
* **Compact** - Unique Base64 encodes IDs to minimize wasted space.
* **Timely** - Unique includes a timestamp to the millisecond in its IDs.
* **Orderly** - Unique IDs are lexicographically ordered by time.
* **Random** - Unique includes 122 random bits in its IDs.

*Definition:* `base64(bin(hex(now()) + uuidV4()))`

Where:

* `now()` returns an integer representing milliseconds since epoch
* `uuidV4()` returns a 32 character hex string (no dashes)
